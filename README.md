# Cinema visit

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

You have opened your own cinema. To have a better idea 
of what's going on in the cinema 
you decided to keep a record of events in the cinema.
For this purpose you have to create such modules:

1. In directory `app` create package `cinema`. In this
package create modules:  
   - `bar.py` - inside this module create `CinemaBar`
   class that describes work of cinema bar.
   This class should have only one static method `sell_product`,
   that takes `product` - name of the product that customer wants
   and `customer` - `Customer` instance, that means customer.
   This method prints what product and to whom cinema sold.
   
   ```python
   cb = CinemaBar()
   customer = Customer("Bob", "popcorn")
   cb.sell_product(customer=customer, product=customer.food)
   # Cinema bar sold popcorn to Bob.
   ```

   - `hall.py` - inside this module create `CinemaHall`
   class that describes actions during the movie session. Its
   `__init__` method takes and stores `number` - number of the hall
   in cinema.
   This class should have only one method `movie_session`, that
   takes `movie_name`, `customers` - list of a customers
   (`Customer` instances), `cleaning_staff` - cleaner (`Cleaner` 
   instance). This method prints about movie start, calls 
   customers method `watch_movie`, prints about movie end,
   calls cleaner method `clean_hall`.
2. In directory `app` create package `people`. In this package
   create modules:
   - `customer.py` - inside this module create `Customer` class,
   its `__init__` method takes and stores `name`, `food` - food that 
   customer wants to buy in cinema bar. 
   This class should have only one method `watch_movie`, this 
   method takes `movie` and prints what movie customer is watching.
   
   ```python
   bob = Customer(name="Bob", food="popcorn")
   bob.watch_movie(movie="Madagascar")
   # Bob is watching "Madagascar".
   ```
   
   - `cinema_staff` - inside this module create `Cleaner` class,
   its `__init__` method takes and stores `name`. 
   This class should have only one method `clean_hall`, this method
   takes `hall_number` - number of hall that cleaner have to clean and
   prints that cleaner is cleaning that hall.

   ```python
   anna = Cleaner(name="Anna")
   anna.clean_hall(hall_number=5)
   # Cleaner Anna is cleaning hall number 5.
   ```

In the module `main.py` you have to import all this classes. Classes
should be imported by absolute path, that starts with 'app.' with 
keyword 'from'. Write a
function `cinema_visit` that takes `movie_name`, `customers` - a list 
of customers, elements are dicts with 'name' and desired 'food' of a 
customer, `hall_number` - number of the hall in cinema, 
`cleaning_staff` - name of the cleaner, that will clean the
hall after movie session.

This function should make `Customers` instances, instance of `CinemaHall`
and `CinemaBar`, instance of `Cleaner`. First, cinema bar should sell food to
customers, then cinema hall should make a movie session and finally cleaner
cleans cinema hall.

Example: 
```python
customers = [
    {"name": "Bob", "food": "Coca-cola"},
    {"name": "Alex", "food": "popcorn"}
]
hall_number = 5
cleaner_name = "Anna"
movie = "Madagascar"
cinema_visit(customers=customers, hall_number=5, cleaner="Anna", movie="Madagascar")
# Cinema bar sold Coca-cola to Bob.
# Cinema bar sold popcorn to Alex.
# "Madagascar" started in hall number 5.
# Bob is watching "Madagascar".
# Alex is watching "Madagascar".
# "Madagascar" ended.
# Cleaner Anna is cleaning hall number 5.
```
